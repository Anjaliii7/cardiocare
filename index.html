          <span>The Heart‚Äôs Strength and rarity of Cancer.</span>
          <p class="fact-detail">
            Your heart is a powerful pump‚Äîeach minute, it circulates around 1.5
            gallons (5.7 liters) of blood throughout your body. Over time, this
            flow adds up: in less than a year, your heart could pump enough
            blood to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. This constant effort
            highlights just how tirelessly the heart works to keep you alive and
            healthy. Heart cancer is extremely rare because the heart is
            composed mostly of cells called cardiomyocytes, which stop dividing
            shortly after birth. Most cancers form in tissues with rapidly
            dividing cells, making them more prone to mutations. Since heart
            cells rarely divide, there's a lower chance for such mutations to
            occur. Additionally, the heart‚Äôs constant motion and rich blood flow
            may create an environment less favorable for tumor growth. As a
            result, primary heart cancers like cardiac sarcomas are
            exceptionally uncommon.

          <span>Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally.</span>
          <p class="fact-detail">
            It accounts for nearly 18 million deaths each year. The most common
            type is coronary artery disease, which restricts blood flow to the
            heart. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
            smoking, obesity, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Many heart
            diseases are preventable with early lifestyle changes, regular
            checkups, and awareness of symptoms like chest pain or shortness of
            breath.

            percent.</span
          >
          <p class="fact-detail">
            Laughter is great for heart health. It improves blood flow by up to
            20%, relaxes blood vessels, and reduces stress hormones like
            cortisol. Laughing also increases oxygen intake, relaxes muscles,
            lowers inflammation, and boosts the immune system. Plus, it
            strengthens social bonds, which are linked to better heart health.
            In short, laughter supports both physical and emotional well-being.

          <span>Smoking doubles the risk of a heart attack.</span>
          <p class="fact-detail">
            In fact, smokers are twice as likely to suffer a heart attack
            compared to non-smokers. The harmful chemicals in tobacco damage the
            lining of blood vessels, raise blood pressure, reduce oxygen in the
            blood, and cause the heart to work harder. Even exposure to
            secondhand smoke can increase heart disease risk. Quitting smoking
            greatly improves heart health and reduces the risk within just a few
            years.

          <span>Walking 30 minutes a day lowers heart risk.</span>
          <p class="fact-detail">
            Regular brisk walking helps improve circulation, reduce blood
            pressure, manage weight, and boost heart function. It also lowers
            bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases good cholesterol (HDL).
            Consistent daily walking is one of the simplest and most effective
            ways to support long-term heart health.

            Eat heart-friendly foods that fuel your body and boost
            cardiovascular strength.
          </p>
          <div class="card-detail">
            <p>
              Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better
              nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal
              health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth,
              lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and
              cardiovascular disease), and longevity. Healthy children learn
              better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can
              create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and
              hunger. Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats
              to human health.

              Regular physical activity improves blood circulation, strengthens
              your heart, and significantly reduces stress levels. Just 30
              minutes a day of moderate movement ‚Äî whether it's brisk walking,
              cycling, yoga, or dancing ‚Äî can greatly enhance your
              cardiovascular health. Exercise helps regulate blood pressure,
              boosts mood by releasing endorphins, and improves sleep quality.
              It also assists in maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the risk
              of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol ‚Äî all major
              contributors to heart disease.

          <div class="card-detail">
            <p>
              Routine health checkups play a crucial role in maintaining heart
              health, even when no symptoms are visible. Many heart-related
              conditions, such as high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol,
              develop silently over time. Regular screenings ‚Äî including blood
              pressure measurement, cholesterol level analysis, blood sugar
              tests, and ECGs (electrocardiograms) ‚Äî help detect issues early
              before they become serious. Early diagnosis allows for timely
              lifestyle changes or medical interventions that can prevent
              complications like heart attacks or strokes.

          <div class="card-detail">
            <p>
              Chronic stress is a silent threat to heart health. It triggers the
              release of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which over time
              can lead to high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and even
              cardiovascular disease. Prolonged stress also encourages unhealthy
              coping mechanisms such as overeating, smoking, or lack of physical
              activity, which further strain the heart. Incorporating
              stress-reduction techniques into your daily routine can
              significantly improve your well-being. Simple practices like
              meditation, mindful breathing, journaling, or yoga calm the mind
              and reduce heart strain.

          <h3>Hydration</h3>
          <p>Stay hydrated for optimal heart function.</p>
          <div class="card-detail">
            <p>
              Drinking enough water plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy
              cardiovascular system. Proper hydration helps regulate blood
              volume, supports smooth circulation, and ensures that essential
              nutrients and oxygen are efficiently delivered to organs‚Äîincluding
              the heart. Dehydration, on the other hand, can cause blood to
              thicken, forcing the heart to work harder and potentially leading
              to fatigue or dizziness. To keep your heart functioning optimally,
              aim for at least 8 glasses (about 2 liters) of water daily. If
              you're physically active or in a hot climate, your body may need
              even more. A hydrated body means a well-supported heart‚Äîso sip
              regularly throughout the day for steady energy, better focus, and
              improved heart performance.
